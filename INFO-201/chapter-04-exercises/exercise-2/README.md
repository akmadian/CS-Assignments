# Exercise 2
Using the text-edit of your choice (e.g., Atom), create a new file called `README.md`. Alternatively, you may clone this repository and edit this file.

In your `README.md` document, make a three column table of the current courses you are taking, with separate columns for course number (in **bold**), course title (in _italics_), and instructor name.

| Course Number | Course Title                              | Instructor        |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| **201**       | _Technical Foundations of Informatics_    | Kyle Thayer       |
| **200**       | _Intellectual Foundations of Informatics_ | Scott Barker      |
| **290**       | _Orientation to Informatics_              | Laura Schildkraut |
| **180**       | _Intro to Data Science_                   | Bob Boiko         |
