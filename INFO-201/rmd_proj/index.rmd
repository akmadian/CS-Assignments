## This is an R Markdown report.
It gets values from the analysis.R file. analysis.R generates a vector of `r n_numbers` numbers with 
a mean of `r mean_numbers` and a standard deviation of `r stdev_numbers`. This particular sample
yielded a mean of `r sample_mean`. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
n_numbers <- 50
mean_numbers <- 25
stdev_numbers <- 10

sample <- rnorm(n_numbers, mean_numbers, stdev_numbers)
```

The sampled values have been plotted in the below line chart.
```{r}
plot(sample, type="o")
```
