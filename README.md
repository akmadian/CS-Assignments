# cs
This is a repo of all of all of the assignments I've done in CS/ CS related classes.

Submodules by nature point to commits, but I've just been using them as a convenient way to nest repos within
this one. I always just checkout the main/ master branch after initing and it works perfectly.


There are only Java, R, and maybe one or two matlab files in this repo itself, but I've worked with several languages including C, x86 assembly, HTML/CSS/JS, SQL, and shell scripts, among others. I may add some of these files manually.

If you're a student, don't use any of these to cheat.
