# cs
This is a repo of all of all of the assignments I've done in CS/ CS related classes.

Submodules by nature point to commits, but I've just been using them as a convenient way to nest repos within
this one. I always just checkout the main/ master branch after initing and it works perfectly.

If you're a student, don't use any of these to cheat.
