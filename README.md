# cs
This is a repo of all of all of the assignments I've done in CS/ CS related classes.

Submodules by nature point to commits, but I've just been using them as a convenient way to nest repos within
this one. I always just checkout the main/ master branch after initing and it works perfectly.

The courses, their names, and the languages used are as follows
| CSC 142 | Programming I | Java |
| CSC 143 | Programming II | Java |
| CSE 373 | Data Structures and Algorithms | Java |
| CSE 374 | Intermediate Programming Concepts | C, x86 Assembly, Shell Scripting, a tiny bit of Rust |
| CSE 413 | Programming Languages and Their Implementation | racket |
| CSE 414 | Database Systems | SQL |
| INFO 201 | Technological Foundations of Informatics | |
| INFO 340 | Client-side Development | JS, HTML/CSS, React |


Not all of the languages I've worked with in my classes will be represented in the GitHub languages breakdown.

If you're a student, don't use any of these to cheat.
