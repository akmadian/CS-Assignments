I didn't have a very good experience with using Azure DB. It was consistently very slow, taking minutes to execute even basic queries like "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table". I would sometimes wait several minutes just to be met with a syntax error message or connection error message.

As a result, I didn't have the opportunity to test any of my queries on the Azure cloud itself, but I did do my absolute best to ensure my syntax is valid and proper without it.

Cloud DBs are increasingly popular because of promises to handle scaling (vertical AND horizontal). I think the idea of offering this kind of service is really amazing.
DBMS services offer a vast amount of value, mostly because they negate the need to stand up and maintain DBMS servers all on your own. Azure and companies like it
take care of deployment of your DBMS around the world, handle speed, security, maintenance, and scaling. I think DBMS cloud services are an amazing value add to basically
any company or developer.
