  As for the bit about nodes vs edges in the knowledge graph, I would say that items, or pages in wikipedia terms, would definitely be nodes,
  and edges would be relationships in the data between those pages/ nodes.

  Given that we know the user is in Seattle, we can use the "Seattle" node and check if there are any links within some number
  of degrees of separation that give a match for other terms. If there are some number of matches, we can sort the possible results
  by number of matches with nodes to have some idea of relevance.

  For this, we might want to use some edge weights.
  The weight for "President" would probably be higher for Joe Biden generally than Ana Marie Cauce since Biden is far more relevant to
    people in general today. Even though the weight for Cauce would be relatively higher since the user is in Seattle, it wouldn't be
    enough to counter the high weight of Biden.

  "President UW" could return Cauce because the user's location, Seattle, has a close link to UW, and UW has a direct link to Cauce.
    We would probably have fewer degrees of separation via these two links than, maybe, Seattle -> Washington -> U.S. -> President -> Biden

  If we go by the user's location, we could go Seattle -> Washington, and that would be a match for one of the terms, but Washington state
    doesn't have a president, so we could probably ignore the user's location data. Then, we could check Seattle -> Washington -> U.S. -> President,
    then from the U.S. Presidents page, we have a direct link to George Washington.
