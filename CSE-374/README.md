This dir contains my work from CSE 374: Intermediate Programming and Concepts.

My own work is in the `my-work` dir, the `submodule` dir allows me to cd into the class git repo from my own cs repo.

Within `my-work`: all of the ec* dirs were extra credit projects, most of my extra credit projects are things that are
included in my dotfiles.
 - `ec1`: Basically a copy of ls with my own modifications, I now use exa instead :/ The most current version can be found [here](https://github.com/akmadian/dotfiles/blob/main/.local/bin/lss.c).
 - `ec2`: An early version of my DWM status bar. The most current version can be found [here](https://github.com/akmadian/dotfiles/blob/main/.config/dwm/statusbar.sh)
 - `ec3`: An artifact of my experimentation with various mail clients. A shell daemon that fetches new mail every 10 minutes. Most current version is [here](https://github.com/akmadian/dotfiles/blob/main/.local/bin/mutt-daemon.sh).
