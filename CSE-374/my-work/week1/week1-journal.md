 - I read the syllabus
 - I created a basic C program that takes some input, terminated by the ! character, and prints the number of characters, number of words, and number of vowels contained in the input string.
 - I spent about half an hour on this assignment.
 - There weren't too many annoying parts, just the usual discomfort with learning new things.
 - It was nice to be in contact with the concept of chars again, the idea that each char corresponds to an integer is very intuitive and eye opening about how everything in programming is based on integers.
