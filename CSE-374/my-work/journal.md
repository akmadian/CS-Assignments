 - I read the syllabus
 - I created a basic C program that takes some input, terminated by the ! character, and prints the number of characters, number of words, and number of vowels contained in the input string.
 - I spent about half an hour on this assignment.
 - There weren't too many annoying parts, just the usual discomfort with learning new things.
 - It was nice to be in contact with the concept of chars again, the idea that each char corresponds to an integer is very intuitive and eye opening about how everything in programming is based on integers.

 - Starting on week 2 work

### Jan 24, 2021
 - I'm just now getting around to starting week 3 work, very behind schedule. I've been jammed up with other classes and just working on trying to stay up to date.
 - I'm excited to get some hands on experience with pointers.

  - Finally finished up my week3 main assignment, it was quite fun nailing down all the little bugs and seeing the algorithm get closer and closer to working properly.

It's been a while since I've written anything, but this week, I did a bunch of work on my first extra credit project, a clone of the ls command with some of my
own personal modifications, and my week 5 work.

It's been another long while since I've written anything, and I got a lot done today.

I finished up my first and second extra credit projects, and got caught up on week 6 work.
Assembly was actually a super fun challenge. I had a really great time with the challenge,
and found one of the more difficult things to be thinking about how to do things that are
easy in higher level languages such as basic control flow, and assigning the result of a
computation to a third variable.

I also had a lot of fun using gdb to step through the assembly line by line to find out
exactly what was happening, which helped me nail down an elusive bug (had to do with my cmpq
comparison).

I also now have a working status bar with multiple update speeds, something I have been
in dire need of for a few weeks now. I'm very happy to have found a nice compromise between
functionality and performance (i want the time to update a few times per second), which is
pretty quick, but only need system hardware info to update once every 5 or so seconds, which
is good since it takes more cpu to handle.
